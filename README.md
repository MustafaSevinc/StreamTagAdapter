# StreamTagAdapter
A Dart adapter for parsing and extracting data between specified tags in a continuous character stream. StreamTagAdapter efficiently monitors start and stop tags using a sliding window technique, provides timeout and buffer size handling for safe extraction, and outputs matched segments for streamlined data processing.
I created this in case it might be helpful to someone. Ready for use and open to improvements and suggestions!
